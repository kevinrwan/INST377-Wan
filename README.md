# INST377-Wan


Hello! My name is Kevin Wan, and I am a Senior majoring in Information Science 
at UMD, with a minor in Statistics. I am also doing the Data Science specialization
track for my major, as I hope to work with designing and developing databases after
graduating. I hope to use the web development skills I learn in this class to create
my own websites and web server environments. These are crucial skills to have as a 
database developer, and I hope to use them to position myself better in this industry.
